Features implemented
1. Breadth First Search
2. Depth First Search
3. Greedy Best Search
4. A Star 

Bugs
The program will continue to search if the goal is not found (until the memory is not enough). Probably needs to limit the number of nodes created.

Missing
I already do my best to not miss anything
